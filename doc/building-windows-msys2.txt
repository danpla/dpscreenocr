1 Dependencies
==============


1.1 Overview
------------

To build dpScreenOCR, you will need the following tools and libraries:

Required:

  * C++ compiler with C++11 support
  * CMake 2.8.12 or newer
  * Make
  * Qt (4 or 5)
  * tesseract
  * pkg-config (to find tesseract)
  * dos2unix package (line endings conversion)

Optional; can be disabled with CMake options:

  * libintl (gettext runtime; DPSO_ENABLE_NLS option)
  * gettext tools (msgfmt is needed to compile message catalogs;
      DPSO_ENABLE_NLS option)
  * pandoc (to generate HTML manual; DPSO_GEN_HTML_MANUAL option)


1.2 Installing MSYS2
--------------------

We will work in MSYS2 environment, so the first thing to do is to
visit https://www.msys2.org/ and follow the instructions.

MSYS2 provides three shells: MSYS shell ("MSYS2 MSYS") and two MinGW
shells for 32 and 64-bit environments ("MSYS2 MinGW 32-bit" and "MSYS2
MinGW 64-bit"). You will never need the MSYS shell; instead, pick a
MinGW shell depending on whether you want to build a 32-bit or 64-bit
version of the program. The 32-bit application will work on both
32-bit and 64-bit Windows.


1.3 Installing dependencies
---------------------------

Run in a MinGW shell:

    pacman -S --needed \
        dos2unix \
        make \
        $MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX-cmake \
        $MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX-gcc \
        $MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX-qt5 \
        $MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX-pkg-config \
        $MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX-tesseract-ocr \
        $MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX-tesseract-data-eng \
        $MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX-gettext

Several notes:

  * The command uses the MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX variable, which is
    defined by both MinGW shells. For example, if you run it in 32-bit
    shell, it will install 32-bit versions of packages with
    "mingw-w64-i686" prefix.

    The MSYS shell ("MSYS2 MSYS") does not define this variable. If
    you want to run the command in the MSYS shell for some reason,
    define the variable explicitly:

        MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX=mingw-w64-i686

    Alternatively, you can simply prefix each package name manually.

  * Tesseact data files don't depend on the architecture, so there is
    no need to install "tesseract-data-eng" and other languages for
    both i686 and x86_64; when building for x86_64, you can use data
    from i686 and vice versa.

    Alternatively, you can download the languages as described in the
    user manual instead of using MSYS2. Still, be aware that CMake
    will automatically copy the "tessdata" directory for the current
    architecture to the build directory.

  * In MSYS2, gettext utilities and the runtime library (libintl) come
    in one package.


1.4 Installing Pandoc
---------------------

MSYS2 does not provide Pandoc, so you have to download it from
https://pandoc.org. You can choose either an installer or a ZIP
archive. In both cases, the simplest way to use Pandoc with CMake is
to copy pandoc.exe in the build directory.

If you want to use Pandoc trough the PATH environment variable added
by the installer, you will need to tell the MINGW shell to inherit the
system PATH using one of the following ways:

  * Extend PATH:

        export PATH="${PATH}:path_to_pandoc_exe_parent_dir"

  * Set MSYS2_PATH_TYPE=inherit environment variable, or uncomment the
    appropriate line in msys2_shell.cmd, which resides in your MSYS2
    installation directory.

  * Append -use-full-path when invoking a shell:

        msys2_shell.cmd -mingw32 -use-full-path


2 Building
==========


2.1 General
-----------

In the simplest case, you can build dpScreenOCR with the following
commands:

    cd path_to_dpscreenocr_source
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
    make

This will create the release build in standard configuration (all
optional dependencies enabled). It will also create and copy all
necessary data files:

  * "doc" dir - all documents: manual, license, changelog, etc.

    Depending on whether the DPSO_GEN_HTML_MANUAL CMake option was
    enabled, the manual will be either in plain text or HTML format.

  * "locale" dir - compiled gettext catalogs. Only created if the
    DPSO_ENABLE_NLS is enabled.

  * "platforms" dir - platform-specific Qt plugins

  * "tessdata" dir - Tesseract data files. CMake will copy that
    directory from "$MINGW_PREFIX/share", and then remove "osd" and
    "equ" traineddata files, which are not used by dpScreenOCR.

  * "translations" dir - standard Qt translations. Only created if the
    DPSO_ENABLE_NLS is enabled.

However, you will not be able to run the executable yet, because CMake
doesn't copy DLL files. Copying DLLs in described in the corresponding
section below.


2.2 Copying DLLs
----------------

CMake only copies DLL files from the "$MINGW_PREFIX/share/qt5/plugins"
directory. Other DLLs need to be copied manually with the following
command:

    cp $(sed -e "s:^:$MINGW_PREFIX/bin/:" ../doc/msys2-dlls.txt) .

The command makes a list of absolute paths to required DLLs by
appending the "$MINGW_PREFIX/bin/" prefix to every DLL name from the
"doc/msys2-dlls.txt" file, and then copies every path to the current
directory. MINGW_PREFIX variable is expanded to the full path of
either 32 or 64-bit MinGW root directory, depending on which MinGW
shell is used.

If you're lucky, you can now successfully launch "dpscreenocr.exe".

If you're not, Windows will tell you a name of the missing DLL file.
Copy that file from "$MINGW_PREFIX/bin/" and try to run the EXE again.
Repeat this process till dpScreenOCR launches successfully.

The reason why copying of DLLs is not automated by CMake and why
"msys2-dlls.txt" may not contain all the names of required DLLs is
that MSYS2 can pull a new version of a library on update. After this,
the name of the library and the list of its dependencies (other DLLs)
may change as well. In fact, these things can happen even if the
version of the library stays the same, but its building configuration
changes. All this means that the list of required DLLs may change
after an MSYS2 update, and after this some names in "msys2-dlls.txt"
may not only be missing, but also be unnecessary.

Consequently, the only reliable way to get the list of DLLs after an
MSYS2 update is:

  1. Remove all DLLs from the build directory.

  2. Copy every library by hand from "$MINGW_PREFIX/bin/".

  3. Save the new list of DLLs to a file to be reused till the next
     MSYS2 update:

         ls *.dll | sort > dlls.txt

     Alternatively, you can do this with a file manager like Total
     Commander or Double Commander.


2.3 CMake options
-----------------

To list all CMake options, run:

    cmake -LH ..

Non-standard options specific to dpScreenOCR have "DPSO_" prefix.

Several notes:

  * If you don't need the translated interface (that is, you only need
    English), disable DPSO_ENABLE_NLS.

  * Some options specific to Qt (like DPSO_QT_LOCAL_DATA and
    DPSO_QT_RCC_ICONS) are intended for non-Windows platforms, so you
    don't have to touch them.


3 Packaging
===========

To create packages, run:

    cpack -G <generators>

Where <generators> is a semicolon-separated list of generator names:

  * ZIP - ZIP archive.

  * 7Z - 7z archive. Has higher compression ratio than ZIP.

  * NSIS - EXE installer using NSIS. To install NSIS, run:

        pacman -S --needed $MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX-nsis

  * WIX - MSI installer using WIX toolkit. You need to download WIX
    from https://wixtoolset.org/ (either an installer or a ZIP archive
    with binaries) and tell CPack the path to its binaries in one of
    the following ways:

      * With CPACK_WIX_ROOT CPack variable:

            cpack -D CPACK_WIX_ROOT="c:\\WiX Toolset\\bin" ...

      * With WIX environment variable:

            export WIX="c:\\WiX Toolset\\bin"
            cpack ...

      * By extending PATH environment variable:

            export PATH="$PATH:/c/WiX Toolset/bin"
            cpack ...

    Note that the first two variants accept both native Windows (like
    "c:\\WiX Toolset\\bin") and Unix-style (like "/c/WiX Toolset/bin")
    paths. For the third option you should always use a Unix-style
    path to avoid the colon after the drive letter to be interpreted
    as PATH separator.

For example, the following command will create a 7z archive and an
EXE installer:

    cpack -G "7Z;NSIS"
