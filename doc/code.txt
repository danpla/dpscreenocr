Some notes about code

* Don't use UTF-8 string literals (u8""). Since C++20, their type is
    changed from char to char8_t, breaking the backward compatibility.

    To insert UTF-8 bytes in a string, use 3 digit octal escape
    sequences. Don't use hex sequences, as they consume as much valid
    hex characters as possible. The only exception is when they are
    separated from the rest of the string by literal concatenation:

        "\xC2\xA9" "2018" (gives Â©2018)

* In Qt code, you can implicitly create QStrings from UTF-8 data.
    Qt 5 uses fromUtf8() to convert from const char* and QByteArray.
    For Qt 4, which uses fromAscii(), we have setCodecForCStrings() in
    main.cpp.

* Unfortunately, Tesseract requires "C" locale during OCR (see
    src/dpso/ocr.* for details), forcing gettext to return English. As
    a workaround, we need to cache translatable strings that are set
    while OCR is active. By convention, such strings are grouped in
    structs named DynamicStrings.

* By convention, all global configuration macros and CMake options
    have DPSO_ prefix.

* ENABLE_NLS=1 macro should be defined to enable gettext. If you use
    dpso_utils/intl.h, this can be done with DPSO_ENABLE_NLS CMake
    option (enabled by default). If you use your own gettext.h, set
    ENABLE_NLS manually.
