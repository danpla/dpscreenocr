  * Added text showing the total number and size of selected languages
  * "Update" tab header now shows the number of languages available
    for update
* Added a "Settings" tab that includes:

      when it is minimized or closed (use the notification area icon
      to show it again).
  * "Behavior" group
    * A checkbox to play a sound when recognition is complete. If
      enabled, you can also select a custom audio file to use instead
      of the built-in one.
    * A checkbox to automatically check for updates at startup. By
      default, the updates are checked no more often than once a week.

  * German
  * Spanish
  * Turkish

  * gettext 0.19


1.2.0 (2022-09-09)
==================

* On X11, selection border now scales proportionally to the system
  font DPI setting (the "Xft.dpi" property from X resources)
* Windows 8.1 and newer:
  * Selection border now scales proportionally to the display DPI
  * Fixed selection position when moving it to a display with a
    different DPI
* Reduced default selection border width from 4 to 3 pixels
* Added selection_border_width option in settings.cfg to change the
  selection border width


1.1.0 (2022-07-17)
==================

* Added system tray icon
* Enabled high DPI support in Qt 5
* Languages:
  * All names are now inverted, e.g. "Creole, Haitian" instead of
    "Haitian Creole"
  * Fixed missing name for jpn_vert
  * jpn is no longer identified as vertical
  * Fixed missing "l" in "Cyrillic"
* Added \ to the list of keys for the hotkey
* If there are multiple texts in the recognition queue, "Add text to
  history" and "Run executable" actions now process each text as it

* History:
  * Removed "Wrap words" checkbox (the history_wrap_words option in
    settings.cfg is still available)
  * Recognized text is now immediately added to the history file to
    minimize possible data loss in case of abnormal program
    termination
  * Font size is now taken from system settings. This also fixes
    zooming text with Control + mouse wheel

    * " and ' are no longer replaced by &quot and &apos
    * CSS: Reduced left text margin from 2 to 1 em and added 1 em
      right margin
  * "Export history" file dialog now uses "History" as the default
    file name instead of leaving it empty
  * "Export history" file dialog now remembers the file name until you
    close the program
  * "Export history" file dialog is now native when using Qt 4
* Unix:
  * Program is now relocatable, e.g. it now loads resources from paths
    relative to the location of the executable, rather than from
    absolute paths based on the installation prefix
  * Moved from "Utility" to "Graphics" menu to comply with the
    freedesktop.org standard
* X11:
  * "Copy to clipboard" no longer sets text to the PRIMARY clipboard

    "C:\Users\(your name)\AppData\Local\dpscreenocr\tesseract_5_data"
  * Enabled native interface theme
  * App now shows progress in the background of the taskbar button
  * Updated Tesseract to 5.2.0
  * (Windows 10 version 1903 and newer) Added a workaround for
    Tesseract that fixes an empty language list when the application
    resides in a path containing Unicode symbols not supported by the
    current code page
  * Default history export path is now the user's home directory
    instead of the directory of the executable
  * "Run executable" no longer opens Explorer if the path is empty
  * "Run executable" no longer executes a batch file if its name has
    trailing spaces or upper-case characters in the extension
* settings.cfg:
  * New options:
    * ui_tray_icon_visible
    * ui_window_minimize_on_start
    * ui_window_minimize_to_tray
  * Removed options:
    * action_run_executable_wait_to_complete; waiting is now always
      enabled
    * ocr_dump_debug_image was replaced by the DPSO_DUMP_DEBUG_IMAGE
      environment variable
    * ui_native_file_dialogs
  * Leading and trailing double quotes are no longer treated
    especially; if you need to preserve leading and trailing spaces,
    wrap the value in \ instead of double quotes. This change is not
    backward compatible with version 1.0, but in practice it will only
    affect the action_copy_to_clipboard_text_separator option.
